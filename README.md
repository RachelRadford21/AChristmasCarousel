# A Christmas Carousel
## The iOS version of A Christmas Carousel app I made with React.
## This is just a fun project for downloading Christmas images that you can use for zoom backgrounds at work.

## You will need an API key from Unsplash. You can get one for free after registering for a dev account from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com)

### I am using this project to use SwiftData for the first time. Which means it works but I plan on improving it as I learn.
