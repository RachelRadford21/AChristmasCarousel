# A Christmas Carousel
## The iOS version of A Christmas Carousel app I made with React.
## This is just a fun project for downloading Christmas images that you can use for zoom backgrounds at work.

## You will need an API key from Unsplash. You can get one for free after registering for a dev account from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com).  
If you do not have an API key I have updated the app with local christmas images for downloading.

### I am using this project to learn SwiftData and use it for the first time. Which means it works(ðŸ¤ž) but I plan on improving it as I learn.

# Things:
 - SwiftData is an absolute joy to use.
 - I learned about ImageRender() which made downloading an AsyncImage incredibly easy.
 - I would have structured my models differently. The way I structured them caused me to have issues retrieving the photographers name, which is not ideal.
